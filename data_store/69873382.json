N Relocation? N Position Type Non-Management POSITION SUMMARY As the original house of luxury, St. Regis continues to redefine modern luxury through service. At the core is the Butler program, an icon to our heritage and the heart and soul of new luxury. It is high-touch, personalized, creative and original. It is brought to life by all talent but serving as the primary face to the program is our Butler team, who are the ultimate luxury ambassadors. The Senior Butler oversees the functioning and delivery of butler services. You verify that there is a seamless approach to the pre-arrival, guest stay and at departure through St. Regis brand standards. You supervise the work of the Butler team – comprised of Butlers and Butler Valets – and drive strong coordination with other departments. Responsibilities also include people management tasks including interviewing and hiring Butler team members and creating schedules to ensure optimal staffing levels. While the St. Regis brand is steeped in history with roots that can be traced back to the early 1900s, every team member is part of a trailblazing future to redefine modern luxury through service. The Senior Butler’s success is rooted in a deep passion for service, uncompromising standards, the ability to anticipate needs and impeccable interpersonal skills. You will also be expected to create a safe work place, follow company policies and procedures, uphold quality standards, and ensure your uniform, personal appearance, and communications are professional. Butler team members will be on their feet and moving around (stand, sit, or walk for an extended time) and taking a hands-on approach to work (move, lift, carry, push, pull, and place objects weighing less than or equal to 50 pounds without assistance). Doing all these things well (and other reasonable job duties as requested) is critical for Butler team members – to get it right for our guests and our business each and every time.
