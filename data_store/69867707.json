A key challenge comprises crop failures and yield losses, triggered by the vagaries of climate. These put at risk the livelihood of a large proportion of India\u2019s population viz. 138 million farm families, constituting the largest private enterprise and contributing more than 18% contribution to national GDP. Agricultural production shocks have huge social and financial repercussions, impacting rural income levels, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and poverty rates.The Government of India\u2019s flagship scheme Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) compensates farmers for crop losses.  The scheme insures farmers against a wide range of external risks \u2014 droughts, dry spells, floods, inundation, pests and diseases, landslides, natural fire and lightning, hailstorms, cyclones, typhoons, tempests, hurricanes, and tornadoes.  While insuring farmers against crop losses is not a new initiative, the PMFBY constitutes a serious attempt to plug gaps identified in earlier crop insurance schemes viz. the National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) introduced in 1999 and the Modified NAIS (mNAIS) introduced in 2011.UNDP\u2019s Country Programme Document (2018-2022) approved by the Government of India defines \u201cInstitutional and Systems Strengthening for Service Delivery\u201d to be one of its foremost programme priorities and the single most important innovation for achieving last mile developmental impact. UNDP leverages its expertise in systems strengthening to support the Ministry of Agriculture through setting up a Technical Support Unit (TSU) for the implementation of PMFBY, to improve institutional and programme responsiveness, increase coverage and better access among marginalised and excluded farm households, offering innovative measures for risk management and reduced crop loss for the rural population in India.  The TSU will also focus on providing Capacity Building and Training support to participating state-level government departments involved in PMFBY and advancing the scheme among new states for improved uptake.
